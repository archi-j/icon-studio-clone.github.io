Hi, my name is Jihoon Chung and this is my blog used for archiving studies in my spare time. Iâ€™m currently enrolled in a master program in architecture &amp; architectural engineering at Yonsei University and work as a graduate researcher in <a href="http://big.yonsei.ac.kr/">Building Informatics Group</a>. My research area is construction 3D printing and computer vision, and also I love architectural design. Iâ€™m interest in creating a whole new ecology of architecture using digital fabrication. Thank you for stopping by and I wish you all the best.<br /><br />

Hi, my name is Jihoon Chung and this is my blog used for archiving studies in my spare time. I'm currently enrolled in a master program in architecture & architectural engineering at Yonsei University and work as a graduate researcher in [Building Informatics Group](http://big.yonsei.ac.kr/). My research area is construction 3D printing and computer vision, and also I love architectural design. I'm interest in how digital fabrication creates a whole new ecology of architecture. Thank you for stopping by and I wish you all the best.<br><br>
